Hi! I'm Facundo Quiroga. I'm 32 years old and I live in Salta, Argentina.
I' m a lawyer and i have been working for 8 years in the palace of justice of my city in penal tribunals doing legal projects and human resource management.
IT (Information technology) has been my passion since I can remember.
At the moment Iâ€™m studying to get certified tech developer degree from digital house where I learned HTML, CSS, JS and SQL.
I expect to work and learn more about my passion and, some day, works in projects about IT and law.
Welcome to my repository!!
